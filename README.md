# CHRUN_Prediction_In_Telecom_Sector
## Project Overview

This project focuses on churn in the telecom sector using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify factors that contribute to customer churn and develop a predictive model that can help telecom companies retain their customers.

### Project Structure

- **app.py**: This is the main application file that integrates and data for deployment.
- **Churn Analysis - EDA.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- **Churn Analysis - Model Building.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for building and evaluating the churn prediction model.
- **first_telc.csv** and **tel_churn.csv**: Datasets used for training and testing the model.
- **model.sav**: Saved trained model for future use.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies required to run the project.

### Dependencies

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed. You can install them using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Surya-KF/HRUN_Prediction_In_Telecom_Sector.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd CHRUN_Prediction_In_Telecom_Sector
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   This will start the application and load the saved model for making predictions. **Explore the data**:
   - Open `Churn Analysis - EDA.ipynb` to understand the dataset and initial analysis.
   - Open `Churn Analysis - Model Building.ipynb` to see the model building and evaluation process.

### Data

The project uses two datasets: `first_telc.csv` and `tel_churn.csv`. These datasets contain customer as usage patterns, billing information, and churn status.

### Model

The model is built using machine learning algorithms and saved as `model.sav`. You can load this model in `app.py` to make predictions on new data.

### Contributions

Contributions are welcome. Here are some ways you can contribute:

- **Improve Model**: You can try different machine learning algorithms or hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering**: Add new features or transform existing ones to enhance the model's performance.
- **Documentation**: Improve this README or add comments to the code for better understanding.
